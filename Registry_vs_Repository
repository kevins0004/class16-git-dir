Registry

A Docker registry is a storage and distribution system for named Docker images.
The same image might have multiple different versions, identified by their tags.

A registry can be hosted publicly or privately -- like a repository -- or by a third party.




Repository


A repository is a collection of container images or other artifacts in a registry that have the same name,
but different tags.

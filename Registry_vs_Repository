Registry

A Docker registry is a storage and distribution system for named Docker images.
The same image might have multiple different versions, identified by their tags.

A registry can be hosted publicly or privately -- like a repository -- or by a third party.




Repository


A repository is a collection of container images or other artifacts in a registry that have the same name,
but different tags.


Dockerfile main commands
 
- FROM ** Must be the first command in a Dockerfile, with this command we set the image that will be used as base in our image.

- ADD ** To move a file into a container directory, it can be .tar files.

- CMD ** It defines a command to be executed when a container with this image initializes.

- LABEL ** Use it to set a container's description and keep it easy to manage all containers.

- COPY ** Similar to ADD, but you can copy normal files and directories.
